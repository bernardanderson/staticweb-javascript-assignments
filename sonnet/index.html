    How like a winter hath my absence been<br>
    From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br>
    What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br>
    What old December's bareness everywhere! <br>
    And yet this time removed was summer's time;<br>
    The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br>
    Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br>
    Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br>
    Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br>
    But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;<br>
    For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br>
    And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br>
    &nbsp&nbspOr, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,<br>
    &nbsp&nbspThat leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.<br>
